# Simulations of integrable stochastic systems

## data, source code, visualizations



##### Dear colleagues:

Feel free to use code (unless otherwise specified at a corresponding document linked from <a href="http://lpetrov.cc/simulations/">http://lpetrov.cc/simulations/</a>), data, and visualizations to illustrate your research in talks and papers,

Some of the images are available in very high resolution upon request.

I can also produce other simulations upon request - email me at <a href="mailto:lenia.petrov@gmail.com">lenia.petrov@gmail.com</a>
